"TrackUSF"

A software for analysis of rodents' Ultra-Sonic vocalizations

"TrackUSFs" is a software that analyze ultrasonic vocalization activity in audio clips. It is doing so by detecting
ultra-sonic fragments of 6 ms duration within each clip and comparing these fragments between a collection of
clips that were collected during an experiment. It is also useful for separating non-vocal strong sounds
fragments (such as noise from scratches of the cage floor) from the ultrasonic vocal ones. For more details,
please refer to the paper:
Netser S., Nahardiya G., Weiss-Dicker G., Dadush R., Yizhaq Goussha, Harony-Nicolas H., Lior Cohen,
Crammer K., and Wagner S. TrackUSF, a novel methodology for fully automated analysis of ultrasonic
vocalizations, reveals modified social communication in a rat model of autism.
